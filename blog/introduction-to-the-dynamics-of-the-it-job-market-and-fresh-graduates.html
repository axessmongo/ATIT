                                Some Common Mistakes Fresh Graduates Make During The Recruitment Process Include
                                Submitting Generic Resumes And Cover Letters, Not Preparing Adequately For Technical
                                Interviews, And Failing To Showcase Their Practical Skills Through Projects Or
                                Portfolios. It Is Important For Fresh Graduates To Be Proactive, Diligent, And
                                Well-Prepared Throughout The Recruitment Process.
